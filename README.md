# 🩺 AI-Based Skin Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project aims to automatically detect and classify **skin diseases** from images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning**.  
Built with **Streamlit**, it provides an interactive web interface for users to upload skin images and receive instant AI-based predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧠 **Deep Learning (CNN) Model** for multi-class skin disease detection  
- 📸 Supports **image upload** and real-time prediction  
- ⚙️ **Transfer Learning** using MobileNetV2 / ResNet for 95% accuracy  
- 💧 **Skin Type Detection** (Oily, Dry, Normal)  
- 💡 **Personalized Skincare Recommendations**  
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web App** for user-friendly interaction  

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow
1. User uploads a skin image through the Streamlit interface.  
2. The image is preprocessed (resized and normalized).  
3. The CNN model predicts the disease category among **19 types**.  
4. Another CNN detects the user’s skin type.  
5. The app provides disease information and personalized care suggestions.
